The **InstaCloneDB** project is a relational database designed to mimic the core functionalities of a social media platform, such as Instagram. This database is created for data analysis and exploration, offering a structured and realistic dataset that you can use to practice SQL queries, conduct data analysis, or develop data-driven applications.  While it is primarily designed for PostgreSQL, the SQL language and concepts can be applied to other relational databases as all the SQL languages have simillar syntax.

# Project Highlights

- **User Management**: Efficiently manage user profiles, including user information and interests.
- **Interactions**: Capture various user activities, including post likes, comments, comment likes, and more.
- **Hashtags and Bookmarks**: Categorize posts with hashtags for easy discovery and bookmark posts for future reference.
- **Data Integrity**: Store media content like images and videos in URL format, maintaining data integrity.
- **Realistic Dataset**: Efforts and research have been dedicated to presenting data in its true storage form.
- **SQL Query Insights**: Our SQL queries reveal the intricate connections and interrelations between different activities on a social media platform.
- **Frontend Integration**: **InstaCloneDB** is designed with the intention of being easily connectable to a frontend interface, making it an ideal choice for developing social media applications.

With **InstaCloneDB**, we've aimed to create a simple yet precise representation of a basic social interconnecting site. The project not only provides a learning resource for SQL enthusiasts but also serves as a solid foundation for building social media applications with real-world data.



# Database Tables ðŸ§¾ðŸ§¾

**InstaCloneDB** consists of the following tables:
