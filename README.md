# InstaCloneDB

The **InstaCloneDB** project is a relational database designed to mimic the core functionalities of a social media platform, such as Instagram. This database is created for data analysis and exploration, offering a structured and realistic dataset that you can use to practice SQL queries, conduct data analysis, or develop data-driven applications.  While it is primarily designed for PostgreSQL, the SQL language and concepts can be applied to other relational databases as all the SQL languages have simillar syntax.
